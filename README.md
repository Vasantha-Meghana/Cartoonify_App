# Cartoonify Your Image

A simple yet powerful application built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit** that converts normal photographs into cartoon-like images. This project includes both a **Jupyter notebook** for explanation and a **Streamlit web app** for interactive use.


## How Cartoonification Works
The cartoonify algorithm uses classical image processing steps:
1. Grayscale Conversion – simplifies color complexity
2. Median Blurring – reduces image noise
3. Adaptive Thresholding – extracts edges (sketch effect)
4. Bilateral Filtering – smooths regions while preserving edges
5. Bitwise AND – overlays filtered image with edges to produce final cartoon

These steps are applied in cartoonify_utils.py.
The final result is an image that looks hand-drawn or illustrated, giving it a fun cartoon-like effect.

## Future Improvements
  - Add more filter styles (e.g., sketch, oil painting, pencil sketch)
  - Enable webcam integration
  - Add option to view and save all transformation stages
